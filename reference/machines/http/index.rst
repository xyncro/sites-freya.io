HTTP
====

Freya lets you work with HTTP implicitly, using the typed but low-level tools found in :doc:`/reference/core/index` combined with types and optics, such as the provided :doc:`/reference/optics/index`. These are expressive and effective, but do not impose a particular structure or semantic form.

HTTP is a fairly involved set of standards, and properly implementing the correct semantics of HTTP is not a trivial matter. Dealing with the correct logical approach to negotiating content types, working out the right approach to cache control and correctly expressing the state of the underlying resources, can be quite a lot to design when taken holistically.

**Freya.Machines.Http** is designed to solve this. The Machine lets you define just the properties of a resource you care about, and the Machine library handles the rest. You can specify as much or as little as you wish, all in a type safe manner, and be confident that HTTP semantics will remain consistent and correct.

As noted in the topic on the design of :doc:`/topics/design/machines`, configuration of a machine is the key step in effective use. The HTTP Machine has extensive configuration options.

* :doc:`decisions` -- decisions influence the overall execution of the HTTP Machine, and enable you to define the behaviour of key aspects of your resource by answering true/false questions about the resource.
* :doc:`handlers` -- handlers enable the response to return representations of the resource when appropriate, as well as providing a potential point in the execution of the Machine to set additional headers, etc.
