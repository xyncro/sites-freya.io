Integration
===========

Integrating Freya with other systems (whether servers to host Freya applications, or other software frameworks) is essential. Freya should integrate widely through the use of the OWIN open standard, but it is not always obvious how it should work in practice. Examples and information for integration are given in the following two recipe sections:

* :doc:`integration/frameworks` -- integrating Freya with other frameworks, for example the Suave web framework. Freya plays nicely with others, and further and better integration is always a goal.
* :doc:`integration/servers` -- integrating Freya with servers for hosting. While OWIN is an open standard, the approaches to integrating OWIN vary between server implementations.
